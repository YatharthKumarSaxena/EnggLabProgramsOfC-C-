## ðŸ“– **Introduction**
This repository showcases my programming work from the C/C++ lab sessions conducted during my college journey. While some may perceive college labs as basic or redundant, I found them highly beneficial in solidifying my knowledge of core concepts. Through these labs, I explored a variety of programming paradigms, ranging from basic procedural programming to advanced topics such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, and the use of templates.  

Additionally, these sessions gave me hands-on experience with Ubuntu software, compiling programs, and working with modular code structures, preparing me for real-world software development.

## ðŸ—‚ **Repository Structure**  
- **Total Folders:** 9  
- **README.md Files:** 10 (One for each folder and this main repository)  

### Breakdown:  
1. **Folders**  
   - Each folder corresponds to a specific program or set of related programs learned during the lab sessions.  

2. **README.md Files**  
   - ðŸ“˜ Each folder contains a dedicated README.md file providing detailed explanations about its contents.  

3. **File Structure within Folders**  
   - Each folder contains files with a consistent pattern:  
     - **ðŸ“„ Declaration File (`*.h`):** Defines the function declarations.  
     - **ðŸ“„ Definition File (`*.cpp`):** Implements the declared functions.  
     - **ðŸ“„ Main Program File (`*.cpp`):** Integrates and executes the defined functions.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**
- **Comprehensive Modularity:**  
  Each folder contains code divided into declaration, definition, and main program files, ensuring adherence to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.  

- **Practical Learning:**  
  Each folder reflects the concepts learned on specific days, providing insights into the thought process and the progression of my learning curve.  

- **Template Utilization:**  
  Mastered the use of **templates**, a critical concept for implementing generic data structures and algorithms.  

- **Ubuntu Command Proficiency:**  
  Gained proficiency in using the Ubuntu terminal for compiling and executing C/C++ programs.

## ðŸ§  **Learning Highlights**  
1. **Strengthened Knowledge of C/C++:**  
   - Improved understanding of procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.  

2. **Explored New Concepts:**  
   - Worked extensively with **templates**, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of my code.  

3. **Practical System Knowledge:**  
   - Learned how to navigate, compile, and debug using **Ubuntu** and other Linux-based systems.  

4. **Improved Code Organization:**  
   - Transitioned from writing monolithic, single-file programs to well-structured, modular programs.  

5. **Hands-On Experience with Tools:**  
   - Leveraged tools like virtual machines (VMware, VirtualBox) and Linux terminal commands.
