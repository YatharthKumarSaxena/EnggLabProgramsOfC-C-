## ðŸ“– **Introduction**  
The Day-3 folder delves into the implementation of the **Babylonian Algorithm**, an efficient method to compute the square root of a given number without using built-in modules of C++. The focus was on understanding the algorithm's logic and developing an implementation from scratch.  

This dayâ€™s learning was guided by our college professors, who introduced the concept and helped us practically implement the algorithm through the provided programs:  
1. **BabylonianAlgorithm.cpp**  
2. **MainProgram.cpp**

## ðŸ§  **Learning Highlights**  
1. **Babylonian Algorithm:**  
   - The algorithm iteratively calculates the square root of a number by improving approximations until a desired level of precision is achieved.  
   - It starts with two initial guesses `x` and `y` and refines them iteratively.  

   ### Babylonian Algorithm Definition:
   ```cpp
   double sqrt(double n){
       double x = 1;
       double y = n;
       if(x < y){
           while((y - x) >= 0.001){
               y = (y + x) / 2;
               x = n / y;
           }
       } else {
           while((x - y) >= 0.001){
               x = (x + y) / 2;
               y = n / x;
           }
       }
       return (x + y) / 2;
   }

## ðŸ›  **Final Takeaway**

Day 3 provided invaluable insights into creating efficient algorithms and tackling mathematical challenges in programming. Implementing the Babylonian Algorithm emphasized the importance of precision, modular code design, and edge case handling.

The concept of square root computation, as introduced by our professors, was deeply enriching and demonstrated how algorithms bridge theoretical mathematics with practical programming.
