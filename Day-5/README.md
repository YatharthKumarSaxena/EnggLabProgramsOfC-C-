## ðŸ“– **Introduction**  
Day-5 marks the transition from procedural programming to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. This folder demonstrates the implementation of OOP concepts using a **multi-file programming format**, ensuring better readability and organization.  

The focus lies on creating and using **classes** with proper encapsulation. The **Car** and **Electric_Car** classes illustrate the use of inheritance, data hiding, and function overloading to create robust and modular code.

- **C++ File:** 3
- **README.md File:** 1 (This file you're reading now)  

### Breakdown:  
1. **Files**  
   - ðŸ“„ `Car_ElectricCar.cpp`: Defines the member functions of the `Car` and `Electric_Car` classes.  
   - ðŸ“„ `functions.cpp`: Includes the implementation logic for member functions.  
   - ðŸ“„ `main_program.cpp`: Contains the main program that integrates all components to demonstrate OOP concepts.  

2. **README.md File**  
   - ðŸ“˜ Provides a detailed explanation of the folder's contents and learnings from Day 5.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**  
- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  - Focus on modular programming through the separation of concerns.  

- **Multi-File Programming:**  
  - Member function declarations in class files and definitions in separate implementation files.  
  - Improved code readability and maintainability.  

- **Inheritance:**  
  - `Electric_Car` class inherits from the base `Car` class to reuse and extend functionality.  

- **Encapsulation:**  
  - Data members are kept private or protected to enforce data security.  

- **Constructors:**  
  - Default and parameterized constructors for object creation with different initialization values.

## ðŸ§  **Learning Highlights**  
1. **Modular Programming Approach:**  
   - Utilizing multiple files for declarations, definitions, and implementation to keep the codebase manageable.  

2. **Object-Oriented Concepts Demonstrated:**  
   - **Encapsulation:**  
     - Data hiding through private/protected access specifiers.  
     - Member functions for controlled access to class data.  
   - **Inheritance:**  
     - `Electric_Car` extends `Car` to add electric-specific features.  
   - **Polymorphism:**  
     - Overloading constructors and functions to handle multiple scenarios.  

3. **Programming Techniques:**  
   - Use of **setters** and **getters** for data manipulation.  
   - Efficient handling of class definitions to reduce file clutter and improve maintainability.

## ðŸ›  **Final Takeaway**  
Day 5 introduced the elegance of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the importance of structured coding practices. Through the multi-file programming format, the benefits of modularity and separation of concerns were evident.  

By exploring the **Car** and **Electric_Car** classes, we grasped:  
- How to implement core OOP principles in C++.  
- The role of constructors, member functions, and encapsulation in creating robust programs.  

Dive into the files to experience the seamless integration of OOP concepts and multi-file programming! ðŸŒŸ
