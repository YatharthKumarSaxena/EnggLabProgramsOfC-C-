## ðŸ“– **Introduction**  
This folder delves into the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**, marking a transition from procedural programming to a more structured and modular approach. Here, we explore:  
- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.**  
- Practical implementation of the **multi-file programming format** for better code organization.  

The repository reflects the culmination of knowledge imparted during Day 5 and demonstrates how OOP practices transform code design into something efficient, readable, and scalable.

## ðŸ“‚ **Folder Structure**  
- **Total Files:** 4  
- **C++ Files:** 3
- **README.md File:** 1 (This document).  

### Breakdown:  
1. ðŸ“„ `Car_ElectricCar.cpp`: Contains member function definitions for the `Car` and `Electric_Car` classes.  
2. ðŸ“„ `functions.cpp`: Implements core logic for the classes, keeping functionality modular.  
3. ðŸ“„ `main_program.cpp`: The main driver file integrating all components and demonstrating their practical applications.

## ðŸŒŸ **Core Concepts**  
- **Encapsulation:**  
  - Data members are kept private or protected, ensuring controlled access.  
  - Member functions provide a secure interface for accessing and modifying data.  

- **Inheritance:**  
  - The `Electric_Car` class inherits from the `Car` class, extending its functionality and showcasing the power of reusability.  

- **Multi-File Programming:**  
  - Declarations, definitions, and program execution are separated across files to improve clarity and reduce complexity.

## ðŸ§  **Learning and Demonstrations**  
This repository is designed to **showcase learnings while enhancing programming skills** through:  

1. **Realizing Modularity:**  
   - Our professors emphasized separating declarations from definitions and implementations, ensuring a lean and manageable code structure.  
   - By using multi-file programming, the project avoids bulky files, adhering to clean code principles.  

2. **Practical Application of Concepts:**  
   - **Encapsulation:** Secure and abstract data access.  
   - **Inheritance:** Reuse and extend existing functionality without rewriting.  

3. **Efficient Class Design:**  
   - Data members are declared as private, with public getter and setter functions maintaining data integrity.  
   - Function definitions are separated from class declarations to keep files concise and readable.  

4. **Demonstration of Multi-File Programming:**  
   - **Car_ElectricCar.cpp** contains the logic for `Car` and `Electric_Car`.  
   - **functions.cpp** separates additional functions for modular development.  
   - **main_program.cpp** ties everything together, showcasing the application of OOP principles.

## ðŸ›  **Final Takeaway**  
This repository is not just a showcase of code but a **learning hub for OOP in C++**, demonstrating:  
- The transition from procedural to object-oriented paradigms.  
- The importance of modular and maintainable code practices.  
- How clean code principles enhance understanding and scalability.  

Dive into the files to see these concepts in action and witness the elegance of Object-Oriented Programming! ðŸŒŸ
