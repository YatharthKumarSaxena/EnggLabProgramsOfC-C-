## ðŸ“– **Introduction**  
Day 2 was a turning point in understanding **debugging** and the role it plays in software development. Debugging is not just about fixing bugs but also about uncovering deep insights into how programs interact with hardware and software design principles.  

This day involved experimenting with two critical programs:  
1. **compareDoubleFloat.cpp**  
2. **compareInt.cpp**  

These programs highlighted the impact of precision in computations and the difference in behavior between **floating-point numbers** and **integers** during execution. This was my first encounter with the concept of **binary representation** and its effect on program execution, especially in infinite loops.

## ðŸ§  **Learning Highlights**  
1. **Concept of Infinite Loops:**  
   - Observed how a floating-point variable (`double`) can cause infinite loops due to imprecision during incremental updates.  

2. **Role of Debugging:**  
   - Learned the importance of debugging in uncovering bugs and understanding program behavior.  

3. **Binary Representation Insights:**  
   - Realized how computers interpret decimal values approximately in binary, impacting real-world computations.  

4. **Debugging Process in Detail:**  
   - Steps to debug a program:  
     - **Compile the Program:**  
       `g++ file_name.cpp`  
     - **Start Debugging:**  
       `gdb a.out`  
     - **Break the Program at Main:**  
       `break main`  
     - **Run the Program:**  
       `run`  
     - **Step Through the Code:**  
       `step`  
     - **Print Variable Values:**  
       `p variable_name`  
     - **Exit Debugger:**  
       `q`  
     - **Terminate Infinite Loops:**  
       Use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## ðŸ›  **Final Takeaway**  
Day 2 was a fascinating journey into the world of debugging, precision, and binary representation. By comparing `compareDoubleFloat.cpp` and `compareInt.cpp`, I developed a strong understanding of how computers handle different data types and why precision matters. Debugging is not just a skill but a gateway to uncovering the intricacies of program execution and system behavior.
